# photo-album-react-tailwindcss
Neat little photo album featuring some of my personal favorite cars using React and Tailwind CSS.

Steps to run this locally:
1. Download zip, extract and open in your favorite editor.
2. the api is wired up through a script in Docker so make sure you have that installed or else you want be able to see the images.
3. Run docker-compose up --build in your terminal to install node modules and all dependencies.
4. Go to localhost:3000 and you should have a running version of the app! 

Enjoy (:
